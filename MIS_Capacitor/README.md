# Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Capacitor
The metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor is the most useful device in the study of semiconductor surfaces. Since most practical problems in the 
reliability and stability of all semiconductor devices are intimately related to their surface conditions, an understanding of the surface physics with 
the help of MIS capacitors is of great importance to device operations. Here, we are concerned primarily with the metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) system. 
This system has been extensively studied because it is directly related to most silicon planar devices and integrated circuits.

## Ideal MIS Capacitor
The metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure is shown in Fig. 1, where d is the thickness of the insulator and Vis the applied voltage. Here, we use the convention that the voltage Vis positive when the metal plate is positively biased with respect to the semiconductor body.
