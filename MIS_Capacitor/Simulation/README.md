# Simulation vs Analytical Modeling of a MOS Capacitor
In this section, the electrical properties of MOS capacitor obtained from numerical simulation were compared with those of obtained from the analytical 
equation.

## MOS Capacitor
A MOS capacitor (shown in the following figure) with 1e18 /cm3 p-doping concentration is simulated under different biases.
