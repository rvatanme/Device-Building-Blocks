# PN Junctioins
p-n junctions are of great importance both in modern electronic applications and in understanding other semiconductor devices. The p-n junction theory serves as the
foundation of the physics of semiconductor devices. The basic theory of current-voltage characteristics of p-n junctions was established by Shockley.',* This theory
was then extended by Sah, Noyce, and Shockley3, and by Moll.4

## PN Junctions at Thermal Equilibrium
At thermal equilibrium, Boltzmann statistics and Poisson equation can be employed together in order to model a pn junction. First, let's consider an abrupt pn junction where the acceptor doping concentration of P side abruptly changes to the donor concentration on n side. In this case, a layer named depletion layer (a pile of negative and positive charges at the p and n side, respectively) is created at the interface where no free carrier exists.
