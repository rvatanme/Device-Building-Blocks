# PN Junctioins
p-n junctions are of great importance both in modern electronic applications and in understanding other semiconductor devices. The p-n junction theory serves as the
foundation of the physics of semiconductor devices. The basic theory of current-voltage characteristics of p-n junctions was established by Shockley.',* This theory
was then extended by Sah, Noyce, and Shockley3, and by Moll.4
