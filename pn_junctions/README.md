# PN Junctioins
p-n junctions are of great importance both in modern electronic applications and in understanding other semiconductor devices. The p-n junction theory serves as the
foundation of the physics of semiconductor devices. The basic theory of current-voltage characteristics of p-n junctions was established by Shockley.',* This theory
was then extended by Sah, Noyce, and Shockley3, and by Moll.4

## PN Junctions at Thermal Equilibrium
At thermal equilibrium, Boltzmann statistics and Poisson equation can be employed together in order to model a pn junction. First, let's consider an abrupt pn junction where the acceptor doping concentration of the P side abruptly changes to the donor concentration of the n side. In this case, a layer named depletion layer is created at the interface where no free carrier exists, n(x) = p(x) = 0. Assumming complete ionization, depletion layer contains a pile of fixed negative and positive charges at the p and n side, respectively.

 By applying Poisson equation in the p and n sides of the depletion layer in the sketched pn junction, we get:

 The electric field is then obtained by integrating the above equations, as follows:
