# Metal-Semiconductor Contacts
Metal-Semiconductor contacts have been found many applications in different devices as photodetectors, solar cells, as the gate electrode of the MESFET,
etc. Most importantly, the metal contact on heavily doped semiconductor forms an ohmic contact that is required for every semiconductor 
device in order to pass current in and out of the device.

## Formation of Barrier
When metal makes contact with a semiconductor, a barrier is formed at the metal- semiconductor interface. This barrier is responsible for 
controlling the current conduction as well as its capacitance behavior. In this section, we consider the basic energy-band diagrams leading to 
the formation of the barrier height and some effects that can modify the value of this barrier.
