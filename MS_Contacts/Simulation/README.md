# Simulation vs Analytical Modeling of Schottky Diode
Here, silvaco software is used to simulate the I-V curve of a Schottky diod and the results are compared with analytical results.

## I-V Characteristic of a Schottky Diode
When metal makes contact with a semiconductor, a barrier is formed at the metal-semiconductor interface. This barrier is responsible for controlling the current conduction as well as its capacitance behavior. This means that as long as the nature of metal and semicoductor remains the same, the IV characteristic of a schottky diod doesn't change with doping of semiconductor. The following schottky diode is simulated.
